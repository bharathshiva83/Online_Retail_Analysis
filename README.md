📊 Online Retail Analysis Dashboard – Power BI
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze and visualize online retail data. The dashboard aims to provide deep insights into customer behavior, product performance, geographic trends, and business profitability to support data-driven decision-making.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Significant effort was made to clean and prepare the dataset before building the dashboard:

Removed null and blank values based on their priority and influence on key attributes.

Handled duplicates selectively—retaining records where duplicate entries added value or insight to important attributes.

Standardized column names, reformatted date and time fields, and ensured data consistency.

Performed necessary data transformations using Power Query and DAX.

🛠️ Dashboard Design & Features
